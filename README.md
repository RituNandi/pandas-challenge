As the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district, I am helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I had to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# PyCity Schools Analysis

- My analysis is below 
  
---from the District Summary looks like there are more students that passed or did well individually either in Math or Reading. But there are less number of students did well both in Math and Reading                                                                                 
---from the School Summary looks like Charter School outperformed District school hugely. 
--   There is huge differences in performance(Overall Passing % ~ 40%) between Highetst Performing and Lowest Performing schools.                                                                  
--   For a particular school, Math performances are almost same for grades 9th thru 12th. Same is applicable for Reading as well.                                                                 
                                                                                                 
- Conclusions:                                                  
---    District has to spend more money per student for poorly performing schools                                                                                                                           
---    Large school performed poorly in overall passing %.                                                                                                                                                                         
---    Charter School outperformed District school
